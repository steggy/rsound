SimpleBluetooth Scanner


This is a VERY simple example of basic fast bluetooth scanner
that uses 2 physical bluetooth dongles to detech nearby users at a rapid rate

It is adapted from the bluetooth module in SSAPP (Simple Sensor Architecture for Pervasive Prototyping),
but designed to be even easier to use.

You will need a few libraries to make this work:

sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev python-setuptools python-bluez curl

sudo easy_install simplejson 

To use jabber you will need to install twisted

sudo easy_install twisted

To use Nokoscope you will need a copy of the Nokia eb2lib from nokia.


Caveats:
	This scanner assumes that your servers will be up, and not slow.  If they are down, or really slow
	it will still work, but it won't be quite as synchronous.


Usage:
	python bluetooth_scanner.py --help
	
	# Run with a sample data set:
	python bluetooth_scanner.py -v --input examples/example_files/input.txt \
								--names_file examples/example_files/names.txt 
								
	# post to a URL:
	python bluetooth_scanner.py  --url http://localhost:8000/process.php
	
	# send over jabber (data embedded into presence packets)
	python bluetooth_scanner.py -v --input examples/example_files/input.txt \
								   --names_file examples/example_files/names.txt \
								   --jabber_user=ben@localhost --jabber_password=test 
	
	
	# post to Nokoscope (Alpha Nokia Product)
	python bluetooth_scanner.py -v --input examples/example_files/input.txt \
								   --names_file examples/example_files/names.txt \
								   --nokoscope_user=username --nokoscope_token=489655a
